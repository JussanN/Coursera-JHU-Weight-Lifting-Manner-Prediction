# Predicting the Manner of Weight Lifting Exercise

This the final project of the Practical machine learning course from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

## Goal

In this project, I will have to use the data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. Moreover we have to describe how the model was built, how cross validation is used, what is the expected out of sample error, and why the choices were made.
